The *R* package implements the models proposed in the manuscript "MUSC: MUlti-level variable selection for Spatial Count data." It enables Bayesian variable selection for regression of negative binomial (overdispersed) spatially indexed count data with and without feature grouping using horseshoe, spike and slab, or when grouping the multi-level group extensions of horseshoe or spike and slab priors. It is easily applicable to broader spatial datasets, where the outcome is spatially indexed count data (e.g. State-level cancer incidence counts) with multiple features, and feature grouping (e.g. Population/ SES, Behavior, Smoking, etc).

## Install and load MUSC

We install and load the developmental version of MUSC from GitHub.

## Simulate mildly correlated feature data, $p=50$

Then we simulate $(p-1)=199$ features with a within group correlation of $\rho=0.25$.  For each non-null coefficient $\beta_j$, the signal magnitude was independently drawn from Unif(0.5, 2); all remaining coefficients, intercept included, were set to zero.We set the group size to $M_g = 5$, yielding $G = ⌈(p − 1)/M_g$⌉ groups, with all groups of size five except one, which had four, with the thress selected groups under Case 2 where within a group some features are active and some are inactive, have three, three and four active features.


```{r constructing feature matrix, out.width = "50%"}
set.seed(2025)
N <- 100 # number of observations/ spatial units
p_dim <- 50 # number of features
signal_vec <- runif(10, min = 0.5, max = 2)

Mg = 5 # group size
G = p_dim/Mg # number of groups
group_ind <- generate_group_ind(p_dim, G) # group indicator

#generating the 
nonNull_indices_p50_Case2 <- generate_nonnull_indices(p_dim, group_ind, num_nonnull = 10,
                                                        nonnull_group_structure = "Case2", per_group_nonnull = 3)

Null_indices_p50_Case2 <- setdiff(1:50, nonNull_indices_p50_Case2)  # Complement of nonNull indices

Features <- feature_sim_grouped(N = N, p = p_dim, group_ind = group_ind, 
                            nonNull_indices = nonNull_indices_p50_Case2, signal_vec = signal_vec)
```


## Construct the random effect $\phi$ and neighborhood list

We construct a $10 \times 10$ grid under a queen adjacency structure to simulate the spatial random effect, $\mathbf{\phi}$ with $\nu = 0.1$ with which $\mathbf{y}$ will be generated and the associated neighborhood list. 

```{r constructing-phi, out.width = "50%", message=FALSE, eval = requireNamespace("spam", quietly = TRUE)}
set.seed(2025)

# Create a 10x10 grid of coordinates since we have an N=100 and assuming no repeated measures
coords100 <- expand.grid(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)

# Create a neighborhood structure (using "queen" to classify neighbors as sharing edges and corners) 
nb100 <- spdep::cell2nb(10, 10, type = "queen") 

plot(nb100,coords100)   # Visualization of a 10x10 lattice graph with queen-style adjacency (neighbors share edges or corners)

n_mat100 <- spdep::nb2mat(nb100, style = "B") #b indicates binary 0/1
Q100 <- diag(rowSums(n_mat100)) - n_mat100    #iCAR precision 

## Simulating phi, iCAR spatial random effects
phi <- MUSC::phi_True_func(nu_vals=0.1, Q=Q100, n_space=100)

# plotting phi
df <- data.frame(x = coords100$x,
                       y = coords100$y,
                       phi = phi$phi_nu_0.1)

phi_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(df, ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        ggplot2::geom_tile(ggplot2::aes(fill = phi)) +
        ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = 0) +
        ggplot2::labs(title = paste("Spatial Effect: ", expression(phi), " with ", expression(nu), "=0.1"),
             fill = expression(phi)) +
        ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
        ggplot2::coord_fixed()
print(phi_plot)
```


## Simulate the spatially indexed count data

Then we simulate $N=100$ outcomes with spatial index phi, simulated populations for each spatial unit, and a scale of per 100,000. 

```{r constructing outcome vector, out.width = "100%"}
set.seed(2025)

scale = 100000
pop <- sample(10000:50000, N, TRUE)
 
yy <- y_gen_fun(N = N, r = 1, K = Features$K, beta_true = Features$beta_true, phi_true = phi$phi_nu_0.1, Scale = scale, pop_col = pop, offset = TRUE)
```


## Fit the SS and HS grouped varible selection models

The main function of "MUSC" fits negative binomial models using either the standard horseshoe prior (which.prior = "HS") or spike and slab prior (which.prior = "SS"), or their grouped extensions (specifying the vector of group indicators; *group_ind*). Additionally, these models can be specified to include a spatial random effect (specifying the neighborhood list, an object of class *nb*; *NeighborhoodList*). $X$ denotes the matrix of spatial-unit-level features (dimension $N\times p-1$). *niter* denotes the number of MCMC iterations.*pop_col* is the vector of the population for each spatial unit and *scale* is the desired scale for the rates (i.e. per 100,000).

```{r fitting SS and HS grouped varible selection with offset and spatial random effect, out.width= "50%"}

print(str(HS_group_offset_space)) # check the returned list object
```


## MCMC convergence plots 

The above function returns a list of several objects, including a matrix of the post-burn-in posterior beta estimates, with dimension *niter* $\times p$. We randomly select 4 betas and plot their convergence. 

```{r MCMC-diagnostic-plots, out.width= "100%"}
set.seed(2025)

ran_sam = sample(1:p_dim, 4)
#HS trace plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[1])], main = "HS - beta 13")
MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[2])], main = "HS - beta 12")
MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[3])], main = "HS - beta 36")
MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[4])], main = "HS - beta 26")
```
