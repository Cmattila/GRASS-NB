The *R* package implements the models proposed in the manuscript "MUSC: MUlti-level variable selection for Spatial Count data." It enables Bayesian variable selection for regression of negative binomial (overdispersed) spatially indexed count data with and without feature grouping using horseshoe, spike and slab, or when grouping the multi-level group extensions of horseshoe or spike and slab priors. It is easily applicable to broader spatial datasets, where the outcome is spatially indexed count data (e.g. State-level cancer incidence counts) with multiple features, and feature grouping (e.g. Population/ SES, Behavior, Smoking, etc).

## Simulate mildly correlated feature data, $p=200$

Then we simulate $(p-1)=199$ features with a within group correlation of $\rho=0.25$.  For each non-null coefficient $\beta_j$, the signal magnitude was independently drawn from Unif(0.5, 2); all remaining coefficients, intercept included, were set to zero.We set the group size to $M_g = 5$, yielding $G = ⌈(p − 1)/M_g$⌉ groups, with all groups of size five except one, which had four, with the thress selected groups under Case 2 where within a group some features are active and some are inactive, have three, three and four active features.


```{r constructing feature matrix, out.width = "50%"}
N <- 100 # number of observations/ spatial units
p_dim <- 200 # number of features
signal_vec <- runif(10, min = 0.5, max = 2)

Mg = 5 # group size
G = p_dim/Mg # number of groups
group_ind <- generate_group_ind(p_dim, G) # group indicator

#generating the 
nonNull_indices_p200_Case2 <- generate_nonnull_indices(p_dim, group_ind, num_nonnull = 10,
                                                        nonnull_group_structure = "Case2", per_group_nonnull = 3)

Null_indices_p200_Case2 <- setdiff(1:200, nonNull_indices_p200_Case2)  # Complement of nonNull indices

set.seed(2025)

Features <- feature_sim_grouped(N = N, p = p_dim, group_ind = group_ind, 
                            nonNull_indices = nonNull_indices_p200_Case2, signal_vec = signal_vec)
```


## Construct the random effect $\phi$ and neighborhood list

We construct a $10 \times 10$ grid under a queen adjacency structure to simulate the spatial random effect, $\mathbf{\phi}$ with $\nu = 0.1$ with which $\mathbf{y}$ will be generated and the associated neighborhood list. 

```{r constructing-phi, out.width = "50%", message=FALSE, eval = requireNamespace("spam", quietly = TRUE)}
# Create a 10x10 grid of coordinates since we have an N=100 and assuming no repeated measures
coords100 <- expand.grid(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)

# Create a neighborhood structure (using "queen" to classify neighbors as sharing edges and corners) 
nb100 <- spdep::cell2nb(10, 10, type = "queen") 

plot(nb100,coords100)   # Visualization of a 10x10 lattice graph with queen-style adjacency (neighbors share edges or corners)

n_mat100 <- spdep::nb2mat(nb100, style = "B") #b indicates binary 0/1
Q100 <- diag(rowSums(n_mat100)) - n_mat100    #iCAR precision 

## Simulating phi, iCAR spatial random effects
set.seed(2025)
phi <- MUSC::phi_True_func(nu_vals=0.1, Q=Q100, n_space=100)

# plotting phi
df <- data.frame(x = coords100$x,
                       y = coords100$y,
                       phi = phi$phi_nu_0.1)

phi_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(df, ggplot2::aes(x = x, y = y)) +
        ggplot2::geom_tile(ggplot2::aes(fill = phi)) +
        ggplot2::scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", mid = "white", high = "red", midpoint = 0) +
        ggplot2::labs(title = paste("Spatial Effect: ", expression(phi), " with ", expression(nu), "=0.1"),
             fill = expression(phi)) +
        ggplot2::theme_minimal() +
        ggplot2::coord_fixed()
print(phi_plot)
```


## Simulate the spatially indexed count data

Then we simulate $N=100$ outcomes with spatial index phi, simulated populations for each spatial unit, and a scale of per 100,000. 

```{r constructing outcome vector, out.width = "50%"}
nis <- rep(1,N) # assuming no repeated measures
scale = 100000
pop <- sample(10000:50000, N, TRUE)

 
yy <- y_gen_fun(N = N, r = 1, K = Features$K, beta_true = Features$beta_true, phi_true = phi$phi_nu_0.1, Scale = scale, pop_col = pop, offset = TRUE)
```


## Fit the SS and HS grouped varible selection models

The main function of "MUSC" fits negative binomial models using either the standard horseshoe prior (\texttt{which.prior = "HS"}) or spike and slab prior (\texttt{which.prior = "SS"}), or their grouped extensions (specifying the vector of group indicators; \texttt{group_ind}). Additionally, these models can be specified to include a spatial random effect (specifying the neighborhood list, an object of class \code{nb}; \texttt{NeighborhoodList}). $X$ denotes the matrix of spatial-unit-level features (dimension $N\times p-1$). \texttt{niter} denotes the number of MCMC iterations. \texttt{pop_col} is the vector of the population for each spatial unit and \texttt{scale} is the desired scale for the rates (i.e. per 100,000). Note, for SS with $p=200$, this will take a bit of time. 

```{r fitting SS and HS grouped varible selection with offset and spatial random effect, out.width= "50%"}

SS_group_offset_space <- MUSC(X = Features$X,                 # feature matrix
                              y = yy$y,                        # outcome vector

                              NeighborhoodList = nb100,       # Neighborhood list
                              pop_col = pop,                  # vector of spatial unit populations
                              scale = scale,                  # rate scale
                              which.prior = "SS",             # method
                              niter = 5000)                  # MCMC iterations; use more in practice, brief here for speed 

print(str(SS_group_offset_space)) # check the returned list object

HS_group_offset_space <- MUSC(X = Features$X,                 # feature matrix
                              y = yy$y,                        # outcome vector
                              group_ind =  group_ind,         # group indicator vector
                              NeighborhoodList = nb100,       # Neighborhood list
                              pop_col = pop,                  # vector of spatial unit populations
                              scale = scale,                  # rate scale
                              which.prior = "HS",             # method
                              niter = 5000)                  # MCMC iterations; use more in practice, brief here for speed 

print(str(HS_group_offset_space)) # check the returned list object
```


## MCMC convergence plots 

The above function returns a list of several objects, including a matrix of the post-burn-in posterior beta estimates, with dimension \texttt{niter} $\times p$. We randomly select 4 betas and plot their convergence. 

```{r MCMC-diagnostic-plots, out.width= "50%"}
set.seed(2025)

ran_sam = sample(1:N, 4)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
MCMC_plot(SS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[1])], main = "SS - beta 13")
MCMC_plot(SS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[2])], main = "SS - beta 76", col_trace = "blue", col_mean = "green")
MCMC_plot(SS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[3])], main = "SS - beta 36", col_trace = "pink")
MCMC_plot(SS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[4])], main = "SS - beta 26", col_trace = "gold")

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[1])], main = "HS - beta 13")

MCMC_plot(HS_group_offset_space$Beta[, (ran_sam[4])], main = "HS - beta 26", col_trace = "gold")
```


## Visualize the posterior inclusion probablities (PIP) for SS

Display the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) of each beta with a selection threshold of $0.75$ for the SS based model. Here with so many features, the text size is a but small for legibility and a bit crowded, further adjustments needed with the \texttt{base_size} and \texttt{bracket_base_size} arguments, but left in to show function implementation.

## Visualize the 95% equal-tail interval based credible intervals for HS

Display the 95% ETI CrI of each beta for the HS based model. Within the plot, along the x-axis are the names of the features and above are their respective groups. Here with so many features, the text size is a small for legibility and a bit crowded, further adjustments needed with the \texttt{base_size} and \texttt{bracket_base_size} arguments, but left in to show function implementation.
